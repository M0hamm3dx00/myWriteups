I was fortunate to participate in the 2020 CTF event that lasted 24 days!  the one ctf per day idea turned out to be great for the learning oportunity especially for the CTFs that were touching on new areas;  one would have time to go deeper into the subject matter of the CTF, look for other resources, and then come back to challenge and try again. 

once the event was over on the 24th of december,  i went back and wrote a script for every challenge using python.  Then I wanted to time all 24 flags, so I put them all into one script.  this was done quickly, so no comments to explain the steps :(,  but the best way to understand it is to read along the writeups to understand what the script is trying to do.

<b>comments and suggestions are very welcome.</b>

I want to take this oportunity to thank the CTF maker Arjen Wiersma (https://twitter.com/credmp) and all the whole team of talented people who gave so much of there time and effort to insure the success of this event, both on Discord channel and ctf making  (the badges were great btw)
